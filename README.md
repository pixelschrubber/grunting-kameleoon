- The token will be saved into kameleoon-configuration automatically and used in the single tasks from there

`grunt listSites`
- Get all sites, which are configured in the account

`grunt setSite`
- Set a site for the current setup, this will be saved into kameleoon-configuration automatically

`grunt previewLocalTest`
- Start a local server, with content from scrapeLocalTest, usually index.html and variation-0.html - will listen to localhost:1337

`injectTestAssets`
- This task is being called by scrapeLocalTest in order to insert js and css for the local preview and generating the variations as static files

- delete a local test, provide name as param

`deleteTest`
- delete a remote test, provide id as param

`updateTest`

`grunt createLocalTest`
- This function will create a new test from a template, which is in the folder /template/

`grunt scrapeLocalTest`
- The URL provided in the configuration.json will be used to scrape the page, this will be saved under the /target/ folder, the name will match the testname again
